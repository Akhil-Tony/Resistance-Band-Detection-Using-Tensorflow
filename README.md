## :star: Frameworks used
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Numpy

## :wrench: Application
__The model can be used for automated fitness training application to detect resistance band for excercises.__

## :file_folder: Dataset
This dataset consists of __1984 images__ belonging to two classes:
<br>
*	__with_band: 984 images__
*	__without_band: 1000 images__
* <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiltony/resistance-band-detection">download dataset</a>

## :gear: Data Augmentation 

* Used Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve performance even on poor lighting condition.

## :key: Results

- The model gave 98% accuracy for Resistance Band Detection after training for n Epochs

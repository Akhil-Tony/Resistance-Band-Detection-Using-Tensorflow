## :star: Frameworks used
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Numpy

## Application
__The model can be used for fitness training application containg excersises with resistance band.

## :file_folder: Dataset
This dataset consists of __1984 images__ belonging to two classes:
<br>
*	__with_band: 984 images__
*	__without_band: 1000 images__

## :gear: Data Augmentation 

* Used Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve performance even on poor lighting condition.

## :key: Results

- Thanks to Transfer Learning, model gave 98% accuracy for Resistance Band Detection after training for n Epochs
